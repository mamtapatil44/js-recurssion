# recurssion is concept when function itself call multiple time to fulfill the requirement.
# Itâ€™s a useful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.
# to implement this technique : 
# 1.we need base case : where it will stop execution means stop calling itself.
# 2.Recursive case: This is the part where the function calls itself with new arguments, gradually moving towards the base case
